`Full-Stack Web Developer`
`Data-Pack Developer`

I'm from Argentina, Buenos Aires, and I started programming for fun when I was 10 years old with [Scratch]([https://codepen.io/lucianobrumer](https://www.scratchjr.org/), then I started making scripts and apps with Python and games with pygame, and a long time later I discovered that programming was a job, and that's what I do, it's one of my greatest passions.
