# Hi 👋, I'm Luciano Brumer, alias lullaby.
`Full-Stack Web Developer`
`Data-Pack Developer`

I'm from Argentina, Buenos Aires. I started programming for fun when I was 10 years old with [Scratch](https://www.scratchjr.org/) in the school, then I started making scripts and apps with Python and games with pygame, and a long time later I discovered that programming was a job, and that's what I do, it's one of my greatest passions.
